# COM-AI v3 Session Notes Log

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: AI collaborators (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) MUST append session entries here at the end of each session. This is a MANDATORY requirement from the handover protocol.

## Instructions for AI Collaborators

1. **Always append at the bottom** - never edit or delete existing entries
2. **Use the template below** - fill out completely
3. **Update before ending session** - this is non-negotiable
4. **Reference PHASE2_TRACKER task IDs** for traceability
