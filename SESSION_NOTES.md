# COM-AI v3 Session Notes Log

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: AI collaborators (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) MUST append session entries here at the end of each session. This is a MANDATORY requirement from the handover protocol.

## Instructions for AI Collaborators

1. **Always append at the bottom** - never edit or delete existing entries
2. **Use the template below** - fill out completely
3. **Update before ending session** - this is non-negotiable
4. **Reference PHASE2_TRACKER task IDs** for traceability

## Session History

*Session entries will be appended below this line*

---## Session Entry

**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Session Owner:** Claude
**Reviewer:** N/A
**Task IDs Worked On:** SETUP-001, SETUP-002, SETUP-003
**Intent for Session:** Complete initial COM-AI v3 setup from GitHub repository creation through working server deployment

### What Was Attempted
- Created GitHub repository structure with complete file skeleton
- Set up handover protocol documentation system
- Configured Windows development environment with PowerShell execution policies
- Resolved virtual environment and dependency installation issues
- Fixed import path conflicts and file encoding problems
- Debugged Pydantic configuration parsing errors
- Implemented registry validation system

### What Worked
- Successfully created GitHub repo `com_ai_v3` with 52 files committed
- Server starts and runs successfully on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- All core endpoints functional: /, /docs, /api/health
- Brain system imports and initializes properly (`brain_available: true`)
- Registry validation passes for file structure and naming conventions
- Virtual environment properly configured with all required dependencies

### What Failed / Issues
- Initial batch file path issues due to spaces in folder names ("Com AI v3")
- Unicode encoding errors in Windows console for emoji characters in logs (cosmetic only)
- API providers show "not_configured" status (expected - need API key validation)

### Blockers
- None - server is operational and ready for next development phase

### Next Step
- Phase 2: Implement provider integration to connect API keys with actual provider endpoints
- Add provider health checks with real API validation
- Test multi-provider brain synthesis functionality

### Validation
- Registry Validation Run? Yes ✅
- PHASE2_TRACKER Updated? Pending (need to locate/create tracker)
- Session Notes Updated? Yes ✅ (this entry)

---## Session Entry

**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Session Owner:** Claude
**Reviewer:** GPT (collaborative troubleshooting)
**Task IDs Worked On:** PROV-001, PROV-002, PROV-003, BASE-001
**Intent for Session:** Resolve provider registration failures and achieve multi-provider AI Brain system with graceful degradation

### What Was Attempted
- Diagnosed and fixed OpenAI provider abstract method mismatch (get_health vs health_check)
- Implemented BaseProvider constructor to accept name, api_key, model parameters
- Created stub implementations for Anthropic and Gemini providers with proper signatures
- Updated provider registration logic in main_multi.py for graceful fallback behavior
- Troubleshot multiple import and constructor signature errors across provider classes

### What Worked
- Successfully identified root cause: BaseProvider missing __init__ method
- Implemented proper abstract base class with required constructor parameters
- Created working provider stubs that satisfy abstract method requirements
- Established foundation for multi-provider registration with individual failure isolation

### What Failed / Issues
- Multiple rounds of constructor signature mismatches before identifying missing BaseProvider.__init__
- Abstract method name confusion between get_health() and health_check() methods
- Provider registration still failing after multiple fixes (needs verification of current status)

### Blockers
- Need to verify current provider registration status after BaseProvider.__init__ fix
- Anthropic and Gemini providers are stubs - need real API implementations for full functionality
- Phase Tracker Google Sheet still needs to be created/located for complete handover compliance

### Next Step
- Restart server with fixed BaseProvider.__init__ method and verify all providers register successfully
- Test multi-provider synthesis endpoint to confirm graceful degradation works
- Create missing Phase Tracker Google Sheet with PHASE2_TRACKER, SESSION_LOG, and DECISIONS tabs
- Implement real API calls for Anthropic and Gemini providers (currently returning "not_implemented")

### Validation
- Registry Validation Run? Pending (after provider fixes confirmed)
- PHASE2_TRACKER Updated? No (sheet needs to be created)
- Session Notes Updated? Yes ✅ (this entry)

---## Session Entry

**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Session Owner:** Claude  
**Task IDs Worked On:** PROV-004, API-004, CONFIG-002  
**Intent for Session:** Implement Phase 2 runtime provider preferences and resolve API connectivity issues

### What Was Attempted  
- Fixed Pydantic settings singleton caching preventing environment variable updates
- Implemented real Anthropic provider with actual API calls replacing stub implementation
- Added runtime provider selection query parameters (provider, model, temperature, fallback)
- Updated synthesis endpoints to support provider preferences and model overrides
- Added generate_with_fallback() method to ProviderManager for intelligent provider selection

### What Worked  
- All 3 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) now healthy and making real API calls
- Provider selection system functional: ?provider=anthropic&fallback=false correctly routes to Anthropic
- Real API responses with proper latency tracking and token usage metrics
- Model override working (claude-opus-4-1-20250805 selected correctly)
- Environment variable loading resolved through settings cache removal

### What Failed / Issues  
- Initial model name issues with claude-3-5-sonnet-latest (resolved with correct claude-opus-4-1-20250805)
- Multiple authentication errors due to invalid API keys (resolved with proper Anthropic key format)
- Settings caching prevented real-time environment variable updates (fixed by removing singleton pattern)

### Blockers  
- None currently - all providers operational with real API connectivity

### Next Step  
- Implement usage telemetry logging to logs/usage.ndjson for provider performance tracking
- Add enhanced provider diagnostics endpoints with detailed health metrics
- Test Gemini provider with runtime selection parameters
- Create provider settings UI for frontend configuration

### Validation  
- Registry Validation Run? ✅ (all providers registering successfully)  
- PHASE2_TRACKER Updated? Pending (need to add completed task rows)  
- Session Notes Updated? ✅ (this entry)

## 2025-09-26 — Infrastructure + Providers solid

### What we did
- Flattened repo: moved project from `C:\Users\admin\Com AI v3\com_ai_v3` → **root** (`C:\Users\admin\Com AI v3`), verified `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` = root.
- Cleaned venv and rebuilt at root (`.venv`); fixed pip/uvicorn shims after flatten.
- Added **setup.ps1** + **run.ps1** (and optional `run.bat`) with:
  - `.env` auto-loader (no secrets echoed)
  - GEMINI → GOOGLE key alias for Gemini (`GEMINI_API_KEY` → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
  - `-Multi` switch to launch `api.main_multi:app`
- Fixed environment loading: confirmed `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` present in session.
- Verified **/api/health**: `brain_available=true`; OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini all **configured/healthy**.
- Implemented **real Anthropic provider** (messages API):
  - Swapped stub for SDK call; content-blocks; usage + latency captured.
  - Resolved model/alias issues (`*-latest` → dated model IDs).
  - Successful call with `provider=anthropic&fallback=false` returning real text.
- Confirmed **real generations** via `/api/brain/synthesize`:
  - Default path (OpenAI) OK
  - Forced Anthropic OK (e.g., `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`)
- Logging shows clean startup: brain routes mounted at `/api/brain`; ProviderManager registered all 3.

### Current status
- API keys loaded via `.env`, auto-sourced by `setup.ps1`.
- Multi-provider orchestration running on localhost:8000 (uvicorn reload).
- Health: OpenAI ✅, Anthropic ✅, Gemini ✅.
- Memory backends (Postgres/Firestore) intentionally **not configured** yet.

### Issues we hit (and fixes)
- Pip/uvicorn pointing at old path after flatten → reinstalled/ensured from venv.
- Anthropic 401 (invalid key) → replaced with valid project-scoped key.
- Anthropic 404 (model alias) → switched to valid dated model.
- Override not honored initially → (action item below to wire route/manager prefs).

### Next steps (Phase 2)
- **Runtime provider preferences**: add `provider`, `model`, `temperature`, `fallback` to synthesize route & honor in manager.
- **Usage telemetry**: append `{provider, model, status, latency_ms, tokens}` to `logs/usage.ndjson`; add `/api/health/usage`.
- **Diagnostics**: `/api/health/providers/detail` with last success/error timestamps.
- **(Optional)** Memory backends: Postgres schema & Firestore creds path if needed.



COM‑AI v3 — Phase 2 Detailed Plan (Foundation for Memory, Auth, Quotas, Telemetry & Diagnostics)
1) Purpose & outcomes
Purpose. Establish the reliability and governance foundations (persistent memory, auth, quotas, health, telemetry) that George, the UI, and external platforms (e.g., WorkzApp) require. Without these, George and the UI make decisions “blindly,” and enterprise integrations remain blocked.
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…
Outcomes (Phase 2 exit criteria):
Persistent memory online: PostgreSQL (authoritative) + Firestore (live UI mirror) provisioned, connected, and used by /api/brain/synthesize. (Top priority.)


Authentication & multi‑tenancy enforced for all public APIs.


Quotas/rate‑limits active per user/tenant/provider; standardized 429 responses.


Usage telemetry written per request and aggregated via /api/health/usage.


Provider diagnostics live via /api/health/providers/detail.


Runtime provider preference parity (provider/model/temperature/fallback) with Gemini fully validated across the same parameters.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


These outcomes align with the “Next steps” already captured in the canonical log (runtime prefs, telemetry, diagnostics, Gemini).
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…

2) Scope & sequencing
We split Phase 2 into 2A (blocking foundations) and 2B (interface contracts) to minimize rework and unblock platform integration quickly.
Phase 2A — Blocking Foundations (do these first)
MEM‑001: Provision & wire PostgreSQL + Firestore (dual‑write, PG authoritative; FS mirror for live UI).


AUTH‑001: Authentication & user scoping (single‑tenant now; multi‑tenant‑ready), bearer/API key mapping to user_id.


RATE‑001: Token‑bucket quotas & rate limits (per user and per provider); budget controls.


TRACK‑001: Usage telemetry pipeline → append to persistent store; expose /api/health/usage.


TASK‑008: Provider diagnostics /api/health/providers/detail (latency, success/error timestamps).


PROV‑005: Gemini: validate with runtime selection params (provider/model/temp/fallback).
 These are already referenced as immediate next steps in the canonical session log.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…

 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Phase 2B — Contract & UX prerequisites
CONFIG‑003: Persisted provider preferences (per user/tenant): default provider/model/temp/fallback.


API‑005: Error handling standardization (codes + machine‑readable error shapes).


API‑006: Schema definition & OpenAPI updates for /api/brain/synthesize, /api/health/*, /api/providers/*.


Guardrails to prevent drift: Continue to enforce v3’s registry discipline and One‑Step Rule for each subtask (run registry tools pre/post, update tracker/manifest).
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…

3) Architecture decisions (Phase 2)
3.1 Storage & memory model (Top priority)
Rationale. Phase 1 confirmed all three providers are healthy and callable; memory backends were intentionally not configured. We now make durable memory a first‑class feature.
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…
Pattern: Dual‑store
PostgreSQL (authoritative): durable, audit‑ready, analytics‑friendly.


Firestore (live mirror): powers real‑time UI/session views, optional cache.


Write path: API handler → write to PostgreSQL (authoritative) → fire‑and‑forget mirror to Firestore.
 Read path: default from PostgreSQL; optionally subscribe to Firestore when building live UIs.
PostgreSQL tables (minimum set):
users(id pk, external_id, role, created_at)


sessions(id pk, user_id fk, title, metadata jsonb, started_at, last_active_at)


messages(id pk, session_id fk, role, content, provider, model, tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms, request_id, created_at)


usage_log(request_id pk, user_id, provider, model, status, latency_ms, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_usd, fallback_chain jsonb, created_at) → drives /api/health/usage


provider_preferences(user_id pk, default_provider, default_model, temperature, fallback_policy jsonb, updated_at)


rate_limits(user_id pk, window_start, window_end, requests, tokens, limit_requests, limit_tokens)


provider_health(provider_id, timestamp, latency_ms, success, error_message)


Firestore collections (suggested):
sessions/{sessionId} → userId, title, startedAt, lastActiveAt


sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId} → minimal mirror for UI


preferences/{userId} → provider defaults for quick UI reads


(Optional) providers/{providerId} → sanitized public metadata + current health snapshot


Phase acceptance for persistence: “Firestore connected and storing” and “PostgreSQL fallback working” are listed as milestone checks in the intake plan we’re adopting selectively.
api key intake ideas
3.2 Authentication & user management
MVP: Static API key or signed bearer token maps to user_id + quota tier.


Enforce auth on all write/read endpoints that access user state (sessions, prefs, telemetry).


3.3 Quotas & rate limits
Middleware: token‑bucket per user and per provider; daily/monthly caps; standardized 429 responses with machine‑readable error payload.


3.4 Telemetry & diagnostics (health)
Telemetry: write one record per request to usage_log (provider, model, status, latency, tokens, cost, request_id, fallback_chain). Expose GET /api/health/usage for aggregations (by provider/model/date/user). This reflects the already‑captured “usage telemetry” next step.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Diagnostics: GET /api/health/providers/detail returns last success/error timestamps, rolling latencies, error classes. Also captured in the canonical log’s “diagnostics” next step.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


3.5 Provider configuration & sanitized discovery
Persisted preferences (provider_preferences) replace ad‑hoc query params for default behavior. Runtime overrides remain supported (provider/model/temperature/fallback).
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Public discovery endpoint: GET /api/providers/public returns a sanitized list of enabled providers (name/template/models/capabilities/priority/health), never secrets. This pattern comes from the prior intake proposal and is safe to adopt within v3.
 api key intake ideas

 api key intake ideas


3.6 Error handling & API schemas
Standard error envelope (e.g., {error, code, provider?, request_id}) with correct HTTP status codes across all providers.


OpenAPI/JSON schemas for synthesize/health/providers/config endpoints, contract‑locked for UI and George.



4) Endpoints (additions/changes)
Synthesize
 POST /api/brain/synthesize
 Add fields: user_id, session_id, request_id (UUID).
 Return: {text, provider, model, latency_ms, token_usage, request_id, fallback_used}.
 On error, standardized payload with code and request_id. (Runtime selection params are already supported in v3 and must remain honored.)
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…
Telemetry
 GET /api/health/usage → aggregates from usage_log. Captures the “usage telemetry” action item.
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…
Diagnostics
 GET /api/health/providers/detail → live provider health (latency, success rate, last error). Mirrors the “diagnostics” action item.
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…
Provider config
 GET /api/providers/config → enabled/configured/healthy providers & models (sanitized).
 GET /api/providers/public → strictly sanitized discovery list (no keys, no endpoints). Pattern reused from the intake document.
api key intake ideas
Preferences
 GET/POST /api/config/preferences → persist & retrieve user defaults (PG authoritative, FS mirrored).

5) Security model
Secrets encryption at rest (provider keys) using a stable key (Fernet‑style) before storage; never emit secrets on any public route. The intake plan we’re borrowing from explicitly uses encryption‑first patterns and a public/sanitized endpoint division.
 api key intake ideas


Input validation for provider URLs (block localhost/internal IPs), rate‑limit administration endpoints.
 api key intake ideas


AuthZ: enforce user scoping on sessions/preferences/usage reads.



6) Testing & validation
Migrations apply cleanly; unit tests create/read sessions and messages in PG.


Dual‑write path verified: PG write + FS mirror; reads default to PG.


Rate‑limit breach returns 429 with standardized error; usage logged.


Diagnostics surfaces last error timestamps and rolling latencies.


Gemini parity validated with runtime params and fallbacks (the log shows provider selection already works with real providers; Gemini must meet the same contract).
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Go/No‑Go cues (adapted from the intake plan’s acceptance checks):
Phase 2A complete when: Firestore connected & storing; PostgreSQL fallback working; auth on; quotas on; telemetry & diagnostics endpoints live.
 api key intake ideas



7) Non‑goals (Phase 2)
Full “dynamic provider registry UI” beyond sanitized discovery (that’s a Phase 3 concern; we borrow only the safe public endpoint and encryption patterns now).
 api key intake ideas


Domain‑specific quality scoring and cost‑optimization engines (planned for post‑foundation).


Memory retrieval‑augmented features beyond persistent storage and session loading.



8) Risks & mitigations
Secret leakage → sanitize provider routes; encrypt keys; limit who can register providers.
 api key intake ideas


Cost spikes → quotas + rate limits + usage telemetry dashboards.


Contract drift → OpenAPI‑locked endpoints; registry validation + One‑Step Rule on every change.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Provider instability → diagnostics + fallback policies; parity testing (esp. Gemini).
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…



9) Success metrics
Persistence: ≥99% of completions write to PG; FS mirror lag <1s (eventual).


Governance: 100% of requests carry request_id; telemetry coverage = 100%.


Reliability: P95 provider selection overhead <100ms; provider health visible and accurate. (Benchmarks drawn from the intake plan’s target posture.)
 api key intake ideas



10) Tracker mapping (Phase 2 work items)
MEM‑001 — Provision PostgreSQL + Firestore; DAL + migrations; dual‑write. (Top priority)


AUTH‑001 — API key/bearer auth; user scoping.


RATE‑001 — Token‑bucket quotas; standardized 429 responses.


TRACK‑001 — Usage telemetry + /api/health/usage.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


TASK‑008 — /api/health/providers/detail.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


PROV‑005 — Gemini validation with runtime params.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


CONFIG‑003 — Persisted provider preferences (PG authoritative; FS mirror).


API‑005 / API‑006 — Error standardization + OpenAPI schemas.


Continue to log each completed item in the canonical Session Notes and run registry tools before/after changes (as required by v3).
COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…

11) Strategic alignment — how Phase 2 unlocks the “specialized AI” vision & platform use
Open the AI market to specialized/niche models.
With persistent identity, quotas, telemetry, and a sanitized discovery surface, George can safely route to smaller, highly specialized AIs while respecting cost and health. The sanitized /api/providers/public lets any agent or app discover what’s available without secrets, a key enabler for open orchestration.
 api key intake ideas


Phase 3 can extend this with the provider‑registry patterns (templates, health testing, optional Redis cache) captured in the intake plan—but only after Phase 2 foundations are stable.
 api key intake ideas


Powering WorkzApp & partner platforms.
Auth + memory + quotas deliver multi‑tenant behavior expected by enterprise apps.


Firestore’s real‑time mirror supports responsive UIs; PostgreSQL provides audits/analytics needed by CXO/ops teams. (The canonical log emphasizes these as the next steps.)
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…



12) Day‑1 checklist (what we implement first)
PostgreSQL migrations & DAL (users, sessions, messages, usage_log, preferences, rate_limits, provider_health).


Firestore connection with credentials set; minimal mirror of sessions/messages.


Auth middleware (bearer/API key) with user scoping.


Rate‑limit middleware (user + provider).


Telemetry write path and GET /api/health/usage.


Diagnostics GET /api/health/providers/detail.


Gemini E2E validation with runtime provider parameters already supported in v3.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…



Appendix A — What we are explicitly adopting from the V1 intake ideas now
Encryption‑first key handling (Fernet‑style).


Sanitized /api/providers/public endpoint (no secrets, whitelisted fields).


Template mindset for future adapters (OpenAI‑compatible, Anthropic, Gemini), sequenced after Phase 2.
 api key intake ideas


(We are not importing the V1 file structure or monolithic router; we adapt only the safe, registry‑compliant patterns that fit v3.)
api key intake ideas

Appendix B — References from the canonical notes
Phase 2 “next steps” captured: runtime prefs, usage telemetry, diagnostics, Gemini validation; memory backends were intentionally not configured previously.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Provider selection + real providers healthy (baseline): confirms feasibility of runtime parameter parity for Gemini now.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…


Process discipline: registry validation, tracker/manifest updates, One‑Step Rule.
 COM-AI v3 Handover & Session Lo…



This document is the Phase 2 source‑of‑truth. If a proposed change conflicts with any section above, update this doc first (and the OpenAPI schemas), then implement—so the tracker and code never drift from the plan.
